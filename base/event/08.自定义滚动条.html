                This upcoming winter may be warmer overall, but government forecasters are advising that there may be some "large swings" due to volatile weather patterns.

                The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its winter outlook that warmer-than-average temperatures are forecast for much of the U.S. this winter, with a wetter-than-normal season from December through February across the northern parts of the country.
                
                "No part of the U.S. is favored to have below-average temperatures this winter," according to the outlook.
